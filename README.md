# Tammarielo_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary
The program uses 2 hash tables to manage a music inventory for a radio station and several playlists for Dj's or requests.
Movies contain a title and an artist, as well as a genre definition, and a popularity scale for possible extension of the project. The program reads in a pre-defined list of titles which make up the inventory. Although additional titles can be added as the music library is expanded. The title is the key to the hash-table. Users can print the inventory, or search for specific titles within the inventory, and can also create a playlist and add or delete titles from the playlist as well as delete entire playlists. a "play" function is provided to increase popularity of a song. The name of the playlist is the key to a second hash table.
